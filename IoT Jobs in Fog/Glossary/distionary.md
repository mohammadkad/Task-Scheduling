**Offloading**
Offloading is the process of transferring a computational task (or part of it) from an end-user device (like a smartphone, IoT sensor, or smart car) to a resource-rich node in the fog layer or the cloud.

The primary goal is to overcome the limitations of the end device, such as:
- Limited Processing Power (CPU)
- Limited Battery Life
- Limited Storage Capacity
- Limited Network Bandwidth (in some cases)

By offloading, the system aims to:
- Reduce Latency: Get results back faster.
- Conserve Energy: Save the end device's battery.
- Improve Performance: Execute tasks that would be impossible on the weak end device.
